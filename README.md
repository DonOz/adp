# honors-thesis-jon-le
This is a Clarkson University Honors Thesis Project made by Jonathan Le.

Main ideas for this project are currently:
 1) Study current and past matchmaking practices and rating systems for various videogames and sports, 
 2) Determine algorithms that can be implemented in such a matchmaking system,
 3) Create a web application program interface (API) to receive the information made from step 2 to create the best matchmaking situation,
 4) Analyze results and continue processing.
